MobilityCorp Agentic AI System - Overview Executive Summary 

MobilityCorp's challenges around vehicle availability, charging optimization, and customer engagement are solved through a multi-agent AI system. Five specialized agents work collaboratively to predict demand, optimize vehicle distribution, manage charging, engage customers proactively, and ensure compliance.

1. Wrong Vehicles in Wrong Places 

Solution: Demand Prediction Agent + Redistribution Agent

The Demand Prediction Agent uses machine learning to forecast where and when vehicles will be needed based on:

Historical booking patterns Time of day, day of week, seasonality External events (concerts, sports games, conferences) Weather conditions Real-time booking trends 

The Redistribution Agent acts on these predictions by:

Calculating optimal vehicle distribution across parking bays Generating efficient routes for staff to move vehicles Prioritizing which vehicles to relocate first Balancing current demand with predicted future needs Challenge.

2: Electric Vehicles Running Out of Charge 

Solution: Charging Optimization Agent

This agent prioritizes battery swaps for bikes/scooters and charging for cars/vans by:

Monitoring real-time battery levels across the fleet Predicting which vehicles will be needed soonest (using Demand Agent data) Creating prioritized work queues for staff Ensuring high-demand locations always have charged vehicles Minimizing dead battery incidents Challenge.

3: Low Frequency Usage / Customer Engagement 

Solution: Engagement Agent

This agent transforms occasional users into regular commuters by:

Learning individual travel patterns and preferences Sending personalized notifications about vehicle availability Recommending regular routes and suggesting subscription plans Offering targeted incentives for routine usage Creating habit-forming nudges at the right times Agent Architecture Details 1. Demand Prediction Agent 

Purpose: Anticipate where and when customers need vehicles

Key Components:

ML Models: Time-series forecasting, spatial demand modeling Context Analyzer: Integrates weather, events, traffic data Pattern Recognition: Identifies recurring demand patterns 

Data Inputs:

Historical booking data GPS location history Weather forecasts Local event calendars Traffic patterns 

Outputs:

24-hour demand forecasts by location and vehicle type Confidence scores for predictions Anomaly alerts (e.g., unexpected surge demand) 

Actions:

Triggers Redistribution Agent when imbalances predicted Informs Charging Agent about high-demand vehicles Alerts Engagement Agent about capacity constraints 2. Redistribution Agent 

Purpose: Optimize vehicle placement across the network

Key Components:

Route Optimizer: Finds efficient paths for staff Priority Calculator: Ranks which moves matter most Staff Scheduler: Assigns tasks to available workers 

Decision Logic:

Prioritizes moves that serve predicted high-demand periods Balances workload across staff members Minimizes empty vehicle movements Considers battery levels (won't move dying vehicles) 

Outputs:

Staff work orders with routes and vehicle lists Real-time adjustments based on actual bookings Performance metrics (vehicles in right place %) 3. Charging Optimization Agent 

Purpose: Ensure vehicles have sufficient charge when needed

Key Components:

Battery Monitor: Real-time charge level tracking Usage Predictor: Estimates when each vehicle will be booked Priority Queue: Orders charging/swap tasks 

Prioritization Algorithm:

Critical: < 20% battery + high demand location High: < 40% battery + medium demand location Medium: < 60% battery + any location Low: Routine charging for idle vehicles 

Outputs:

Prioritized battery swap lists for staff Charging station assignments Low battery alerts 

Special Features:

Predicts which bikes/scooters at same bay need swaps Optimizes staff routes to handle multiple swaps per trip Prevents charging bottlenecks at popular locations 4. Engagement Agent 

Purpose: Convert occasional users to regular customers

Agent Orchestration: LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen ML Platform: Databricks or SageMaker Real-time Processing: Apache Kafka + Flink Data Warehouse: Snowflake or BigQuery ML Models: PyTorch/TensorFlow, XGBoost API Gateway: Kong or AWS API Gateway Monitoring: Datadog, Prometheus + Grafana
